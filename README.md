     Okay! Imagine you have two numbers. Let's say they are A and B.

Now, proper divisors are just the numbers that can divide another number without leaving anything behind (and we don’t count the number itself). For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. These are the numbers that divide 6, but 6 itself isn’t counted.

Here’s the cool part about amicable numbers: The proper divisors of A add up to B, and the proper divisors of B add up to A. So, if we add up all the proper divisors of A, we should get B, and if we add up all the proper divisors of B, we should get A.

Let’s look at an example:

Take 220 and 284  
- The proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110. If we add them up:  
  1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284.
  
- Now, the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142. If we add them up:  
  1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220.

Since the proper divisors of 220 add up to 284, and the proper divisors of 284 add up to 220, these numbers are amicable.

It’s like two friends, where each person gives the other a gift, and those gifts add up perfectly!
